## Overview
Sudog is named after 'sudo', a command line that we had a lot of problems with, and 'dog' cause it looks cute, like a dog.
It is a rescue robot capable of advancing rough terrains, picking up objects with arms, and detecting warning signs.
Controlling via 5G wifi and using vision from the camera only, Sudog uses Raspberry Pi4 as the main computer, PCA9685 as a servo driver for the arm, a webcam camera.
